This folder shows sample results of training and testing.

## plot_\{n_iter\}.png files

These picture shows the performance of the cGAN at various points of the training. Specifically, the n_iter is the iteration number to which the file corresponds. For example, plot_010960 shows performance of the cGAN after 10960 iterations.

In each picture, each column represent one sample location. The first row is the satellite image, the second row is the cGAN's translation, and the third row is the actual corresponding Google Map image.

## test_result.png
This is an example of the cGAN's translation of a picture that was not in the training set.
