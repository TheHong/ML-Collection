# ML Collection

This repository contains a collection of ML applications using various ML techniques. The work done in this repo is inspired by Dr. Jason Brownlee's website: https://machinelearningmastery.com/. This repo is therefore my interpretation of his tutorials.

## Inside the ML Collection
| ML Application | ML Model | Description|
| :-------: | :-------: | ----- |
| Image Translation | cGAN | Trained conditional generative adverserial networks to translate between satellite images and Google Maps images. |
| Image Captioning | VGG+LSTM+NN | Used transfer learning and recurrent neural networks to generate captions for image. |
